/*
Create a C++ program that uses a `do-while` loop to simulate a basic calculator.
 The program should repeatedly ask the user for two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and display the result. 
Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation and continue until they choose to exit.
